I am a physics Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley studying neutrinos. The experiment I am working on is called <a href="https://icecube.wisc.edu/about-us/overview/">IceCube</a>, a cubic-kilometer particle detector buried inside the ice at the South Pole. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino">Neutrinos</a> are nearly massless subatomic particles that rarely interact with matter, and IceCube aims to observe high-energy cosmic neutrinos to probe violent astrophysical sources such as supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, and black hole mergers.

Besides physics, I am also interested in data science, machine learning, and their intesections with physical sciences. Welcome to visit <a href="https://medium.com/@yanglyu902">Medium</a> for my data science blogs. 

In my free time, I practice Kendo, a Japanese sword martial art, at my university's club. I also love photography (<a href="https://500px.com/p/yanglyu902?view=photos">here</a> is my 500px page), piano <br/> composition & improvisation, and traveling.
